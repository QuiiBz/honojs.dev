# Getting Started

Hono works on multi-platforms. In this section, we introduce instructions for Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun and Lagon.

In all of them, TypeScript is out of the box, and development on a local environment is easy. And, we can release quickly with Cloudflare Workers. Deno also has the edge platform "_Deno Deploy_", and Lagon offers both cloud and self-hosted options. Maybe Bun will have the edge runtime for publishing.

In this section, you can know the following about each of your platforms:

- Setup environments
- Installation
- "_Hello World_"
- How to run
- How to deploy
- Testing

Let's get started!
